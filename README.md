## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## AI Chat Configuration

The chat page uses a real OpenAI-powered assistant via a Vercel serverless function (`/api/chat`). The API key is **never exposed to the client**.

### Local development

```sh
# Copy the example env file and fill in your OpenAI API key
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env and replace YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE with your real key
```

You can test locally with `npx vercel dev` (requires the Vercel CLI).

### Production (Vercel)

1. Go to your project on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings → Environment Variables**
3. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your secret key
4. **Redeploy** for the change to take effect

> ⚠️ **Never** put your API key in client-side code or commit it to the repository.
